An alternative solution which worked:

 - remove docker and docker-compose installed by brew
 - install Docker Desktop for Mac
 - run it and pass admin credentials to start everything

It resolved issues with "docker deamon not running" as well as some other issues that the other answer didn't (e.g. 0.0.0.0 ports were not redirected with docker installed using brew and worked smoothly with Docker Desktop installation).



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# install Docker
brew install docker
brew install --cask docker

# Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
brew install docker-compose


# Docker machine to create VM and attach to it
brew install docker-machine


# To run machine you need Virtual box
# It’s possible you’ll fail to install VirtualBox. When you do fail, turn on 
# System Preference and see if ‘System software from developer “Oracle America, inc”
# was blocked from loading.’ If you see that message, click Allow button and try to 
# install again.
brew install --cask virtualbox


# To start with it forst install default machine
docker-machine create default


# not always necesery
docker-machine start default


# dont forget to adjust bash_profile with this command
eval "$(docker-machine env default)"

#Trouble: Error checking TLS connection: Host is not running
I ran into a similar issue, believe this occurs when your VM is inactive.
Here's how I remedied the situation

docker-machine rm default

after it's cleaned up you can create a new default machine (assuming you haven't heavily 
modified it, then you'll probably want to script/automate that with packer/terraform etc)

docker-machine create default --driver virtualbox
